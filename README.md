Ansible Role uWSGI
=========

Installs and configures uWSGI daemon.

This playbook highly values the KISS methodology - Keep It Simple Stupid.

- only takes care of uWSGI service installation and configuration -
  deployments would have to go in an extra play/role with a dep on this role.
- supports only a single uwsgi client - if you want to configure more clients, run this
  role multiple times while passing the corresponding facts.

Example Playbook
----------------

    - hosts: all
      vars:
        uwsgi_enabled: yes
        uwsgi_apps:
          - name: example_com
            options:
              socket: 127.0.0.1:3031
              chdir: /var/www/example_com
              virtualenv: venv
              python-path: ..
              module: example_com:application
              processes: 4
              threads: 2
              stats: 127.0.0.1:9191
              master: true
      roles:
         - blunix.role-uwsgi
